      <h4 class="text-white bg-info">What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p class="text-left text-info" style="line-height: 1.8"><strong>Neuroplasticity is the capacity of neurons and neural networks in the brain to change their connections and behaviour in response to new information, sensory stimulation, development, damage, or
        dysfunction. Although some neural functions appear to be hard-wired in specific, localized regions of the brain, certain neural networks exhibit modularity and carry out specific functions while also retaining the capacity to deviate from
        their usual functions and to reorganize themselves. Hence, neuroplasticity is considered generally to be a complex, multifaceted, fundamental property of the brain.<strong></p>

        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-right mt-3">How can this help us?</h4>
              <img class="imgRight mt-2" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6e/cf/d1/6ecfd1a70e130ef078df876e340bdd85.gif" alt="tool">

        Understanding that consistent learning, repetition of a task or recalling a memory will grow and strengthen their neural networks speaks for itself. Practice makes permanent, and so if we do not engage our brains in those areas the electrochemical pathways will not be used and our energy will be focused on other areas of the brain eventually disconnecting the cells that formed the pathway.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify block" style="line-height: 2.2">
        We need to keep learning new things and then reinforce those things by doing them over and over again. Building those new pathways and then keeping them open by using those developed areas. Problem-solving, discussion, journalling, the rubber ducky method. Reinforcing what you know will strengthen these links.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify block" style="line-height: 2.2">
        Now that we understand a bit about Neuroplasticity and how it works it seems almost common sense? Of course, constant learning and repetition will create stronger links and not employing those neurons will have the opposite effect. However it is up to the individual to actively engage in their learning to reinforce these developing pathways. This is where a growth vs fixed mindset comes in to play.

        "When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world (the world of fixed traits) success is about proving you’re smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other (the world of changing qualities) it’s about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself."

      <p class="text-left mt-3" style="line-height: 2.2">
        "Growth Mindset" and "Fixed Mindset" are terms coined by American psychologist Carol Dweck. Over 30 years ago her and her colleagues studied students attitudes and behaviours when faced with problems or the idea of failure. What they found out was that some students would embrace challenges and rise to the occasion to solve the issue, while other students would shy away from a challenge or become sad when faced with the idea of failure.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left mt-3" style="line-height: 2.2">
        From their studies, they found that understanding and applying these mindsets can alter a person's belief about learning and intelligence. What we once thought as being smart or intelligent as being a 'fixed' trait now was overshadowed by the application of effort and perserverance by adopting a 'growth' mindset. The principals of a growth mindset free us from any negative holding patterns we may have. If we go about our lives thinking that our mindset is fixed and we reach a stage where our brains can’t develop or grow we may resign ourselves to accepting that we can’t learn or grow new skills.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-center mt-3">My thoughts and feelings</h4>
      <p class="text-left mt-3" style="line-height: 2.2">
        What Carol Dweck uncovered about mindset,  coupled with the evidence surrounding that our brains are far more malleable than we ever knew is a bull that we must grab by the horns if we are to achieve our full potential! I brought her book and am reading it during my study breaks and most evenings and it drives the message home that if we apply hard work and effort anyone can succeed.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left mt-3" style="line-height: 2.2">
        When we faced with adversity or failure we need to embrace the challenge because that's how we grow and better ourselves. We have to disassociate the negative connotations attached to the word 'failure' because in my eyes and my words I'm happy to be a failure because that's why I'll *explicit word* win. A few years back now I was in a fixed mindset without knowing it. Unhappy with where I was and what I was doing I took up exercise as a form of becoming stronger. Unbeknown at the time I wasn't just physically growing stronger but more so mentally allowing me to enter a growth mindset which I now apply in everything that I do.
      </p>
    <h1 class="text-white bg-dark mb-3">With that in mind, my final comments are if you want to succeed I say <strong>fail first, Fail hard!</strong> With each failure we can become bolder in our approach, building character calluses, igniting and driving us to move faster towards success...</h1>
