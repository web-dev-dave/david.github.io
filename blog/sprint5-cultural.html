          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
          as a result of the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          In the last 5 weeks I have learnt that I love a challenge. I love
          coming from a place of 'not knowing' and through my hard work and
          effort moving to a place of 'knowing'. Establishing new chemical
          pathways and consistent new learning stimulates me and keeps my mind
          sharp.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          I learnt that control of ego (or lack of) can dictate our growth. We
          can fall in to patterns which fuel our ego that can be a blessing or a
          curse to our ability to move through life. Through this
          course/readings and interactions with others have I been more aware of
          the impact our ego plays in life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          I learnt that making smaller goals to meet at the beginning the day
          helps with my feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. If I
          focus on meeting a goal that is too great to achieve that can make the
          day feel wasted if I do not meet it. Breaking down a big goals in to
          smaller ones reminds me that I am progressing.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-right mt-3">
          What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          Nothing is more powerful than surrounding yourself in a positive
          enviroment with similair indivduals who are striving to learn and to
          help one another on your learning journey. Being able to connect
          through values, empathy and self awarness can we unlock invaluable
          tools to further our growth and the growth of others.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          Holding the same values or beliefs we are able to find common ground
          and are able to communicate easier with one another. Showing empathy
          and understanding that others might be struggling we can support and
          further their growth and in turn furthers our own growth, teaching
          others is a great way of reinforcing your knowledge on the area. Being
          self aware we can monitor our learning and change accordingly if we
          can see something is working or something is not working. Being able
          to be self critical and open to criticism allows for reflection and
          the door to moving forward.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-left mt-3">
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning and what was
          the most challenging?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          It has been the most challenging yet most rewarding side of
          foundations. Initially I struggled with it and found it hard to switch
          from writing and learning the technical side of web development to
          then jumping ship and writing blogs on the core side. But as the weeks
          went on I found it easier to explore and understand that both the
          technical and core learning go hand in hand, and reflecting on oneself
          and being self aware can help us push past our limitations and reach
          new heights.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-left mt-3">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          We are heavily reliant on computers and writing in code that it can
          look like to be the best developer we must 'become' a computer or
          understand every inner working of code and I think it's important to
          remember that this is not the case. It's more important that we
          develop human and core skills to attach that to our technical skills.
          I want to be technically profecient at coding but I also want others
          to be able to see that there is values, beliefs and emotion attached
          to what I do and how I work. In a team enviroment we need to be able
          to be relatable and so I think thats why its so important to learn and
          teach these skills.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-center mt-3">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming
          instead?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          Not at all. I think as you can read from my previous reflections that
          it is vitally important to strengthen that side of us. In a world
          where technology is evolving in a rapid rate it is learning and
          growing our core side that helps us remain 'human'. Bringing our
          indentity in to our work I believe will make it more approachable and
          better recieved than work that has no values, beliefs or emotion
          attatched to it.
