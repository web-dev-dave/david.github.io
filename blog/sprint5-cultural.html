          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
          as a result of the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          In the last 5 weeks, I have learnt that I love a challenge. I love
          coming from a place of 'not knowing' and through my hard work and
          effort moving to a place of 'knowing'. Establishing new chemical
          pathways and consistent new learning keeps me stimulated and keeps my
          mind sharp.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          Over the course of foundations I have learnt that control of ego (or
          lack of) can dictate our growth. We can fall into patterns that fuel
          our ego which can be a blessing or a curse to our ability to develop.
          Through this course/readings and interactions with others have I been
          more aware of the impact our ego plays in life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          I learnt that making smaller goals to meet at the beginning the day
          helps with my feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. If I
          focus on meeting a goal that is too great to achieve that can make the
          day feel wasted if I do not meet it. Breaking down big goals into
          smaller ones reminds me that I am progressing.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-right mt-3">
          What is the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and
          programming?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          To grow ourselves nothing is more powerful than surrounding yourself
          in a positive environment with similar individuals who are striving to
          learn and to help one another on your learning journey. Being able to
          connect through values, empathy and self-awareness can we unlock
          invaluable tools to further our growth and the growth of others.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          Holding the same values or beliefs we can find common ground and can
          communicate easier with one another. Showing empathy and understanding
          that others might be struggling we can provide support and further
          their growth and in turn furthers our own, teaching others is a great
          way of reinforcing your knowledge on the area. Being self-aware we can
          monitor our learning and change accordingly if we can see something is
          working or something is not working. Being able to be self-critical
          and open to criticism allows for reflection and the door to moving
          forward.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-left mt-3">
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning and what was
          the most challenging?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          It has been the most challenging yet most rewarding side of
          foundations. Initially, I struggled with it and found it hard to
          switch from writing and learning the technical side of web development
          to then jumping ship and writing blogs on the core side. But as the
          weeks went on I found it easier to explore and understand that both
          the technical and core learning go hand in hand, and reflecting on
          oneself and being self-aware can help us push past our limitations and
          reach new heights.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-left mt-3">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          We are heavily reliant on computers and writing in code that it can
          look like to be the best developer we must 'become' a computer or
          understand every inner working of code and I think it's important to
          remember that this is not the case. It's more important that we
          develop human and core skills to attach that to our technical skills.
          I want to be technically proficient at coding but I also want others
          to be able to see that there are values, beliefs and emotion attached
          to what I do and how I work. In a team environment, we need to be able
          to be relatable and so I think that's why it is so important to learn
          and teach these skills.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-white bg-info text-center mt-3">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming
          instead?
        </h4>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          Not at all. I think as you can read from my previous reflections that
          it is vitally important to strengthen that side of us. In a world
          where technology is evolving at a rapid rate, it is learning and
          growing the core side that helps us remain 'human'. Bringing our
          identity into our work I believe will make it more approachable and
          better received than work that has no values, beliefs or emotion
          attached to it.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-white bg-dark">Preparing for bootcamp</h1>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          As I finish foundations and start gearing up for bootcamp I start to
          reflect where I would like to be in the industry. My long term goal is
          to use the skills I learn at EDA to be able to communicate my ideas
          and bring them into reality. I would like to work in an area's where I
          can help bring people together. I want to use my skills as a developer
          to pay it forward and help the community and environment out. Working
          within a company that holds those values would be great in the short
          term, and further down the track, I will flesh out my ideas and long
          term goals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          During my time at bootcamp, I think my biggest strength will be my
          work ethic and drive to grasp a concept. I will encourage myself to
          help others if I feel in a position to do so and understand it myself.
          Over foundations, I think I have managed my time well and am looking
          forward to strengthening my time management. My biggest weakness will
          be leading a team and my communication skills. But I am excited to
          strengthen these during bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          My biggest non-technical challenge will be realising everyone learns
          at their own pace. Over foundations, I have made myself aware of this
          and am becoming much better and letting go of where in the learning
          path I am in comparison to others. I have been more trusting of myself
          and the learning process. I am also not the greatest public speaker
          and communicator as Iâ€™ve stated above so working in this area will be
          of great help.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.8">
          I watched an EDA graduation this week, and I was blown away by what
          people came up with. It was inspiring to me and I am committed to
          showing up each day and giving it my all. I can't wait to push myself
          and exceed my expectations and limitations my ego may have. I will
          grow both the technical side and non-technical side in me, and if I
          can help others on their journey I will as well.
