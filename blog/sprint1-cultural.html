      <p>These were the values that mean the most to me and ones I hope to embody. Through my research and asking my family, friends, and former work colleagues about what values they saw in me I was more than happy to hear they held the same
        opinions. It can be a daunting task asking others what they see in you when in your mind you may see yourself another way.</p>
      <p>With culture comes identity and culture has played a huge role in crafting my values and identity and still does today. With an ever present social culture manifesting in our daily lives through the arts, through the media, and the internet we are thrust into not just our
        own culture but a melding pot of others which can be hard to seperate from our own culture.<p>In todays world where we are encouraged to physically distance we have become more social connected. Overwhelmed with idea's, values, concepts, beliefs that are not our own. Does this lead us to become culturally 'disconnected' from our place of origin?<p>

        <p>This is not to say a constant evolving ‘collective culture’ is a bad thing. Ideas and information emerges from every direction and is passed and received in a nano second and with so much content but no context it can be hard
        for us to grasp our indentity swimming in this cultural soup. But it’s a culture we must accept.</p>

        <p class="border-bottom pb-3">Take a breath and ground yourself to what values you hold important. We can get so lost in how we perceive
        ourselves based on the perception of others that we can lose our identity. When this happens I look back to my parents and how I was raised to be and the values I was taught; <strong><i>Honesty, Integrity, Compassion, Hard working, Balance, Respect.</i></strong></p>
