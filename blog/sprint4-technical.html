        Wowee what a week it has been. Week 4 almost done and dusted... Safe to say it has been a challenging one for me and one I've enjoyed thoroughly. I discovered a lot about my learning style and problem-solving towards coding and I am proud for the way I managed my time during this week.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        When I first started the kata challenges I found the first two exercises fairly straight forward and easy to navigate my way around. The one's after I found far more challenging and small errors started to occur. One example of this was having to create a block of code that would then show or <strong>return</strong> a message. In my case, the message was "Bilbo won the running event!"
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="imgs/bilbo.png" alt="kata exercise">
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        It took me a while to figure out why I was getting an error. It looked to me as though I was returning the string the way they asked for it. Then I clicked an additional single character <i>"</i> found at the end of my sentence was resulting in the error!
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="imgs/string.png" alt="kata exercise">
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        Where I went wrong was in using a feature called template literals I forgot that the <i>``</i> become <i>""</i> when the feature is executed. Once I fixed this the code worked perfectly! It showed me that such a simple single character error can disrupt the whole code functionality. Great lesson to learn.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white bg-info text-right">Solving a problem with elegance</h2>
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        I think I achieved this when I came to the last challenge in built-in methods. I was happy to see my solution worked by utilizing JavaScript regular expressions. Regular expressions are patterns that we can use to match character combinations in strings. I learnt a bit about regex (regular expressions) through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>
      </p>
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        The challenge was to remove the word "buzz" from any string that was input into the function. So using regex I came up with the following...
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="imgs/regex.png" alt="kata exercise">
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        To breakdown my code I first used the in-built function <i class="text-danger">.replace()</i> this finds something and then replaces it with the second parameter. I had to remove the word buzz completely so I replaced it with an empty string. Using regex syntax <i class="text-danger">(/<strong>Insert what to look for</strong>/)</i> I searched for 0 or more occurrences of the word "buzz" the symbols that preceed "buzz" employ this the <i class="text-danger">\s</i> also removed the white space preceding "buzz". The characters after the word are called flags. The <i class="text-danger">g</i> flag represents global, which means it will search and match all occurrences. Without it, it would just match the first instance of it. The <i class="text-danger">i</i> flag means it is case insensitive. As you can see I typed in "BuZz" and it still matched with "Buzz, buzz, BUZZ" etc.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white bg-info text-center">Learning about how I deal with problems</h2>
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        I've certainly discovered a few methods I encourage myself to keep using to further my learning and how I learn. I am incredibly proud of my goal setting especially earlier in the week when I was stumped with the Kata's I told myself "you have the time, go back and reinforce the basics". I straight away mentioned my plan of attack to my facilitator so that it was set in stone. In doing so I held myself accountable to following through with my plan.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        Not only did I go through the freecodecamp basics a third time. I carried on with the lessons delving deeper into JavaScript (there's quite a lot you can do!). Once I came back to the kata's I felt far more comfortable with them. Most of the exercises I answered myself, only with a few did I have to look at the sample answers but even then I could break down the code and understand what it was doing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 2.2">
        Writing in pseudocode really helped what I was trying to achieve, breaking down the code into smaller parts also helped. I would then console log every step of the way. If it would log what I was expecting then great if it didn't then I would explore why. Multiple occasions I would ask the cohort for help and before I received the answer the process of asking in itself solved the solution.
      </p>
      <p class="text-light bg-dark text-center border-top mb-3" style="line-height: 2.2">
        So reflecting on week 4 I learnt a lot about myself in terms of how I learn and how I attack coding problems, I've also learnt the methods I need to keep utilizing and most importantly I've learnt that we need to go at our own pace. It took courage for me to tell myself slow down, take a step back and start again.
