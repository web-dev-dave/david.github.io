    <div class="container">
      <p>Using the skills I learn from EDA I hope to create a platform/website/app focusing on how we can help struggling youth. The idea is still young but over this course I will aim to evolve and grow my concept as my long term goal.</p>
      <p>To reach my goals I need to work on my communications skills, being able to articulate ideas and solutions better. I feel like EDA is the perfect place to do so. I jump at the chance to help someone out with an issue and canâ€™t wait to come
        together as a cohort in person to discuss and share our thoughts and ideas to develop these skills.</p>
      <p>Describing my strengths and weaknesses in my last blog post has helped me to outline the steps I will need to take to not hinder my learning at EDA. </p>
      <div class="list">
        <ol class="list-plan">
          <li>Keep setting my goals and challenges at the beginning of the day so I can track and be accountable for my continued learning. If I see others falling behind I will do my best to support them as well.
          </li>
          <li>Being patient with myself and my learning pace, not letting others learning curves distract me.
          </li>
          <li>Being upfront with my cohort and facilatotrs if I am struggling with an issue, not keep it to myself and spend hours and hours losing track of time.
          </li>
          <li>Respecting others and treating others the same way I would want to be.
          </li>
          <li>Taking appropriate breaks and know when to step away from the computer to come back stronger the next day.
          </li>
          <li>Respecting the work hours of my cohort and facilatiotrs I will ask them for help once I pass an allotted timeframe on task that I can't grasp.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>In return I ask for full support and encouragement on our learning paths from the facilitators. The ability to teach and not just tell. Not necessarily just giving us the answer but giving us the destination to figure out the answer
          ourselves. This will help me immensely with the steep learning curve.
        </p>

          My only outside commitments is mainting physical exercise. So far I have been going in the mornings which gets me started for the day. I will see how the bootcamp goes and maybe look at afternoons/evenings if suits better.
